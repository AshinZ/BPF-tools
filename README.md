BPF-tools
=========

Brendan's development space for Linux performance tools using extended BPF (eBPF). Directories:

- old/: for old versions of tools built during BPF development and for specific BPF versions.
- new/: new tools, which may still be in development.

None of these are supported or guaranteed to work for you. This is just a place to share what I'm working on.

Please see [bcc] \(BPF Compiler Collection\), where I've contributed many completed tools along with man pages and example documentation.
